There are 5 available presets:
- Variable / Automatic - Uses default settings which are unknown behaviour depending on your Windows Version
- Highest Latency - Sets the buffer size so that you may get the highest latency
- Balanced Latency - This is a tested balanced setting that should be stable on all systems
- Lowest Latency (Logitech) - Lowest latency preset that should work fine on Logitech devices
- Lowest Latency - The lowest latency that systems can usually handle

## Warning: Some latency presets are not stable on certain systems. They may cause unexpected device feeling and glitches such as pointer "teleportation" and mouse clicks not working. This is not a behaviour that you can reproduce everywhere, that's one reason why there are many different available presets.
